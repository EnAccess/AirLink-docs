This is **technical documentation** for AirLink.

!!! info "AirLink"
  AirLink is an open source framework (MIT License) for Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) IoT devices to connect to compatible servers via Bluetooth¬Æ gateways. The protocol provides an interoperable communication standard and example code for wire-free communication between PAYG devices and an IoT server using smartphones as gateways.

If you are looking for an overview of the AirLink project, the landing page is here:
